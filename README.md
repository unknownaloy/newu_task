A streak feature for a todo app that tracks daily or weekly completion and preserves streaks when settings change. Users can customize tracking type, change settings, and view a simple UI. User data is back-up on Cloud Firestore

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you _Node_ installed on your PC. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)
- Ensure you have an IDE installed, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

## Getting Started

## Project Configuration

Cloud Firestore is being used to persist todo data for a user in combination with localStorage, which holds a unique ID for a user. The firebaseConfig.ts file is already included in the project. If you prefer to use your own Firestore configuration, follow these instructions:

- Replace the content of `firebaseConfig.ts` with your own configuration obtained from Firebase.
